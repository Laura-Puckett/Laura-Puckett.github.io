A major heatwave struck the Pacific Northwest in June 2021, and stream temperatures in many locations grew warmer than 68F - a critical threshold over which salmon experience great stress and are more likely to contract diseases or die. Heat-related salmon mortality was recorded in the region as a result of the 2015 and 2021 heat waves.

In this project, I displayed stream temperatures from USGS stations within the Pacific Northwest in an interactive app.
