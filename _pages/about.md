I am seeking a role that will utilize my interdiscplinary background in data science, forest science, and climate science to find solution to ecological and environmental problems.

It all started when I took a climate science class at Virginia Tech and learned about the important and complex carbon dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. I changed my major from Engineering to Environmental Informatics and started doing undergraduate research with the Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting Lab at Virginia Tech, where I discovered my love for scripting and data analysis. Wanting to get more experience working with remote sensing and large spatial datasets, I joined the [Global Earth Observation and Dynamics of Ecosystem Lab](https://goetzlab.rc.nau.edu/) at Northern Arizona University and completed an M.S. in Informatics. I also worked for the Forest Service in Arizona's [Forest Health Protection Department](https://www.fs.usda.gov/foresthealth/), and then spent 1.5 years working as a Data Science Educator developing software and education materials for [Posit Academy](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/).
