I am an aspiring data scientist and ecologist. While getting my B.S. at Virginia Tech, I was a member of the Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting Lab. Then I joined the [Global Earth Observation and Dynamics of Ecosystem Lab](https://goetzlab.rc.nau.edu/) at Northern Arizona University while getting my M.S. in Informatics. Now, I am looking for the next opportunity to hone my skills in data visualization and environmental modeling.
